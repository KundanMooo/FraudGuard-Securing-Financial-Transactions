# FraudGuard-Securing-Financial-Transactions
Empowering Financial Institutions to Defend Against Fraudulent Transactions.

## 1.Identifying Fraudulent Transaction Types:
Task: Develop rules and algorithms for more sophisticated fraud detection in 'Cash Out' and 'Transfer' transaction types.
Challenge: These transaction types are particularly vulnerable to fraud, and creating effective detection methods can be complex.

## 2.Increasing Human Reviewers:
Task: Increase the number of human reviewers specifically for 'Cash Out' and 'Transfer' transactions.
Challenge: Finding and training additional reviewers, and managing their workload efficiently.

## 3.Developing Policies:
Task: Create comprehensive policies for handling 'Cash Out' and 'Transfer' transactions.
Challenge: Ensuring that these policies are both effective in fraud prevention and compliant with regulatory requirements.

## 4.Model Interpretability:
Task: Reduce the decision tree depth to 5 to enhance model interpretability.
Challenge: Balancing model interpretability with maintaining effective fraud detection, as deeper trees may capture more intricate patterns.

## 5.Handling Data Imbalance:
Task: Acknowledge the use of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance.
Challenge: Ensuring that the oversampling technique doesn't introduce bias or compromise the model's accuracy.

## 6.Continuous Model Updating:
Task: Continuously update the model with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
Challenge: Managing the pipeline for model updates and ensuring that the model remains effective as fraud tactics evolve.

## 7.Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:
Task: Implement real-time alerts based on changes in the top features identified by the model.
Challenge: Developing a robust alerting system that minimizes false positives and captures emerging fraud trends promptly.

## 8.Resource Allocation:
Task: Allocate resources and monitoring efforts to features with the highest importance.
Challenge: Optimally distributing resources to effectively combat fraud while maintaining operational efficiency.
